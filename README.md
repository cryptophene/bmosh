## The Bash Mobile Shell - "Mosh Lite"

### Usage: bmosh ssh_server_name

- Provides local echo of ssh commands
- Works great for many tasks over slow connections like Tor Hidden Servers
- Could be extended to offer tab completion, bash like line editing, an actual terminal.

### Unlike [Mosh](https://github.com/keithw/mosh):
- Uses 100% ssh, has security reviews/reputation
- Uses TCP - Works great for many tasks using Tor Hidden Servers
- Is under 100 bytes of smuggler inspired genuis.
